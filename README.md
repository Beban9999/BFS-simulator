# BFS / DFS Simulator

This project is a BFS/DFS Simulator that visualizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms on a grid. The user can set the start and end points, place obstacles, and switch between BFS and DFS algorithms to see how each algorithm explores the grid to find the shortest path.

## Key Components

### HTML (index.html)
- Defines the structure of the web page.
- Includes input fields for setting start and end points.
- Contains buttons to start the algorithm, reset the grid, and toggle between BFS and DFS.
- Displays the grid where the maze is visualized.

### JavaScript (script.js)
- Implements the logic for BFS and DFS algorithms.
- Handles user interactions such as setting start/end points, placing obstacles, and starting the algorithm.
- Updates the grid visualization based on the algorithm's progress.
- Provides functions to reset the grid and toggle between BFS and DFS.

### CSS (styles.css)
- Styles the grid cells, control panel, and other elements on the page.
- Defines the appearance of different cell types (start, end, obstacle, visited, path).

## Functionality
- **Grid Setup**: The grid is dynamically generated with 20x20 cells.
- **User Controls**: Users can set start and end points, place obstacles, and choose between BFS and DFS.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: The chosen algorithm (BFS or DFS) is visualized on the grid, showing the pathfinding process.
- **Reset and Toggle**: Users can reset the grid and toggle between BFS and DFS algorithms.
